How to use the proxy?

All the browsers (chrome, firefox, ie, opera, safari and others) support the proxy option. When you set a proxy in browser, the proxy will fetch the web pages for your browser. The webistes regard the IP of proxy as your IP so it cannot trace your real IP. We recommend using Elite Proxy Switcher to set the proxy for your browsers.
What is the proxy anonymity?

There are 3 levels of proxies according to their anonymity.

    Level 1 - Elite Proxy / Highly Anonymous Proxy: The web server can't detect whether you are using a proxy.
    Level 2 - Anonymous Proxy: The web server can know you are using a proxy, but it can't know your real IP.
    Level 3 - Transparent Proxy: The web server can know you are using a proxy and it can also know your real IP.

How to check the proxy speed?

You can use our free software Elite Proxy Switcher to test the proxy speed. We don't show the speed in the proxy list. It's because one proxy may have different speed for different users. For example, a proxy which is fast for USA users may be slow for European users. So check it by yourself.
What is Google proxy?

Proxies that support searching on Google are called Google proxy. Some programs need them to make large number of queries on Google. View details about Google proxy on our blog.
What is HTTPS / SSL proxy?

Secure websites whose url starts with https:// instead of http:// (ex. https://www.paypal.com) use the encrypted (SSL/HTTPS) connections between its web server and the visitors. Some proxies only support ordinary http sites and can't surf https sites. Elite Proxy Switcher can test whether a proxy supports https sites.
